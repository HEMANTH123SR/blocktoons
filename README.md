## About The Project

![Screen Shot](./public/images/Screenshot%202024-08-31%20043100.png)

BloockToons is a blockchain-based platform where users can discover and read the best webtoons from around the world.

Blockchain Integration: By leveraging blockchain technology, BloockToons ensures that creators receive fair compensation for their work while allowing readers to enjoy unique and high-quality webtoons.

Fractional Ownership: The platform introduces fractional ownership of exclusive webtoon series, enabling readers to collectively own a piece of their favorite series. This not only democratizes access to premium content but also allows fans to invest in the future of their favorite stories.

Why Blockchain: BloockToons uses blockchain to enhance transparency and security in content distribution. This ensures that creators are rewarded fairly, and readers have a stake in the content they love.
