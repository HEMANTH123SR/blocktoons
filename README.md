## About The Project

![Screen Shot](./public/images/Screenshot%202024-09-01%20153058.png)

BloockToons is a blockchain-based platform where users can discover and read the best webtoons from around the world.

Blockchain Integration: By leveraging blockchain technology, BloockToons ensures that creators receive fair compensation for their work while allowing readers to enjoy unique and high-quality webtoons.

Fractional Ownership: The platform introduces fractional ownership of exclusive webtoon series, enabling readers to collectively own a piece of their favorite series. This not only democratizes access to premium content but also allows fans to invest in the future of their favorite stories.

Why Blockchain: BloockToons uses blockchain to enhance transparency and security in content distribution. This ensures that creators are rewarded fairly, and readers have a stake in the content they love.

Problem:-

1. Censorship and Content Control: Centralized platforms often impose content restrictions based on various regional or legal guidelines, limiting creative freedom and access to diverse manga content.
2. Revenue Sharing: Creators are often subject to unfavorable revenue-sharing models, with significant portions of earnings going to intermediaries like publishers and platforms.
3. Access and Ownership: Readers do not have ownership of the content they purchase, and access to their library can be revoked at any time due to platform policies or failures.
4. Single Point of Failure: Centralized platforms can be taken down or suffer outages, leading to a complete loss of access to manga content for readers.

Solution:-

* BlockToons is a decentralized platform leveraging Diamante blockchain technology to provide a fair, transparent, and censorship-resistant environment for manga distribution. The platform operates as a decentralized marketplace where creators can publish, and readers can purchase or access manga directly, without intermediaries.
